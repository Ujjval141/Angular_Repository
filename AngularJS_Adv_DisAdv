AngularJS
---------
-> AngularJS is a client side javascript framework.
-> AngularJS follows the MVC design pattern.

   M-Model
   -------
   (JavaScript variable is called as model in AngularJS.)
   ex- var data="Data from database soon..";
   [Note: Where "data" variable is called as model in AngularJS.]

   V-View
   -------
   (we can use html, html5, or Jade as the view in  AngularJS)


   Controller
   ----------
   (Javascript functions are called as controller in AngularJS)
      ex-  function my_fun(){
             //Business Logic
            }

            [Note: where my_fun() called as controller in AngularJS.]

->AngularJS released by the google.


-------------------------
Advantages of AngularJS
-------------------------

1. AngularJS supports module
----------------------------
   module: Collection of predefined classes implementation in in javascript
           called as module.

           1. ngAnimate: this module used to implement the animation in Angular.

           2. ngStorage: this module is used to work with the storage.
                         Angular supports two types of storage.

                         a)localStorage
                         b)sessionStorage

                         localStorage
                         ------------
                         as a developer we must destroy the local storage explicitly.

                         sessionStorage
                         --------------
                         whenever we close the browser or open the new tab,
                         automatically we will lost the data.

           3. ngMessage: this module used to handle the client side form validation.

           4. ntRoute: Loading the target template to source template in a single page
                       application (SPA) called as routing.

                       -> we can implement routing in SPA by using ngRoute module.
                       -> ngRoute Module is  the native module
                       -> now a days we are not using ngRoute module in SPA.
                          Because it is deprecated.

           5. ui.router: this module is used to implement the Routing in SPA.
                       -> ui.router module is the third party module.
                       -> now a days almost all projects are using ui.router
                          module, because of its advantages.

                          ex- Implement the angular application with the following features.

                           a)Animation support.
                           b)Validation support.
                           c)Single page application (SPA) using "ui.router" module.
                           d)Storage support

                           index.html
                           -----------
                           <! DOCTYPE html>
                           <html ng-app="app">
                             //we can develop Animation,Routing,Validations and Storage.

                             <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js></script>

                             <script>
                                var app=angular.module("app",["ngAnimate","ngMessages","ngStorage","ui.router"]);
                             </script>
                           </html>

                           Explanation
                           -----------
                           ng-app is the prefefined directive used to assign logical name for web application.
                            ex-> ng-app="app"
                            where "app" is the logical name of web application.

                            "angular" is the predefined class in "angular.min.js" file.

                            "module" is the predefined function in angular class and taking two parameter
                              a> logical name of web application.
                              b> array of dependencies

                            "module" will return the javascript object and this object used to implement the
                             controller,services,filters,directives......
                               ex-> var app=angular.module("app",[]);

2. By using AngularJS we can directly work with html DOM.
---------------------------------------------------------
->DOM stands for document object model.

ex- copy the data from one "div" to another "div" by using html and javascript.

index.html
----------
<html>
  <div id="div_one">Hello</div>
  <div id="div_two"></div>
  <script>
     document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML=document.getElementById("div_one").value;
  </script>
</html>

[note: as a html and javascript developer, we must dependent on javascript to manipulate the DOM.]

ex- copy the data from one "div" to another "div" by using AngularJS.

index.html
-----------
<html ng-app>
  <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>
  <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>

  <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>

[note: in above application we have the following predefined directives.]
 ng-app: angular framework starts execution from "ng-app" directive.
 ng-model: "ng-model" directive internally creates the object into heap memory with application data.
 ng-bind: "ng-bind" directive binds the application data (Model data) to the view.

[note: as a angular developer, we can directly manipulate the DOM without depending on javascript.]


3. AngularJS supports the two ways data binding.
------------------------------------------------
->Automatic data synchronization between model and view with the supervision of controller
  called as two ways data binding.

4. Open source code
---------------------
-> as a angular developer we can customize the angular framework according to
   application requirement.

---------------------------
Key features of AngularJS
---------------------------

1.Single page Application
--------------------------
->Loading of target template into source template without refreshing the whole web page
  is technically called as "Single Page Application".
->By default AngularJS supports single page application development.

2. Routing
------------
-> Loading one template into another in SPA is called as routing
-> By default angularJS supports routing in SPA.

3. Directives
-------------
-> Directives in angularJS enhance the capability of html.
-> We can customize the directives as per application requirements.
-> We have two types of directives.

a)Predefined directives
  ex-> ng-app,ng-controller,ng-model,ng-bind...etc
b)Custom directives
  ex-> my-app,my-dir..

4. Services
-------------
-> Services are meant for providing the common business logic to controller.
-> By usning services we can reuse the business logic
-> We have two types of services.

a)Predefined services
    ex-> $http
b)Custom services
    ex-> my_service

5. Filters
------------
-> Filters are used to format the data according to application requirement.
-> We have two types of filters

a)Predefined filters
-the filter given by angular framework is called predefined filter
ex-uppercase
   lowercase
   currency
   orderby
b)Custom filters
-the filter developed by developer based on application requirement called as custom filter.
ex- my_filter
    reverse
    my_currency

*Comparision of AngularJS and Angular2
---------------------------------------

->the vendor of angularJS framework is Google.
-the vendor of angular2&4 is the Google with Microsoft.

->by using angularJS we can create the web application.
-by using angular2&4 we can create web application as well as mobile application
[note: with the help of "ionic" framework we can create the mobile application.]
     "angular2 (or) angular4 + ionic => mobile application"

->we can develop angular (1.x) application by using javascript.
-we can develop angular 2&4 application by using "typescript".
[note: "typescript is the superset of javascript.]

->AngularJS have a poor performance compared to Angular 2&4.
-Angular 2 have five times more performance than AngularJS.

->We can directly render the angularJS application on browser because
  angularJS internally uses the javascript.
-We must convert the "typescript" to "javascript" before rendering on browser
 in Angular 2&4 application.
 Converting the typescript to javascript called as "transpilation".
 we can perform the transpilation with the help of "tsc" compiler.

->Javascript is the interpreted based language.
-Typescript is the compiler based language.

-------------------********--------------------
#Difference between Angular2 and Angular4.
-----------------------------------------------
->Angular2 have less security compared to Angular4.In Angular4 data will be
  encrypted so we can achieve more security.
->Angular4 have more performance compared to Angular2.
->Angular4 modifies the directives to achieve the more performance.
->Angular4 learning is easy compared to Angular2.


-------------------********--------------------
#Difference between AngularJS and NodeJS.
-----------------------------------------------
->AngularJS is the front end javascript framework.
-NodeJS is the server side technology.

->Internally AngularJS uses javascript to develop web application.
-Internally NodeJS uses the javascript to develop the server application

 NodeJS can provide services to(database data) angular 1.x, angular 2.x, angular 4.x, reactJS...


 -------------------********--------------------
 #Difference between AngularJS and reactJS.
 -----------------------------------------------
->AngularJS is the client side javascript MVC based framework.
-reactJS is the client side javascript library.

->Angular have the poor performance while working with the Data structures.
-reactJS are having good performance while working with data structures.
